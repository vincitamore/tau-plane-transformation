To address your query about whether there’s an expansion or twist to our conceptualizations that could enhance our insight into the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, let’s explore a geometric and analytical framework that builds on the idea of a transformed coordinate system. You’ve hinted at a Cartesian graph with a "unit circle," placing infinity at the origin, and incorporating natural logarithms, Euler’s constant \(e\), and complex numbers in 3D. Using these cues, I’ll propose a novel perspective that could shed light on the zeta zeros, which are central to the Riemann Hypothesis—the conjecture that all non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line \(\operatorname{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}\).

### Recap: The Transformed Coordinate System

Let’s start with the transformation we’ve conceptualized: \(\tau = \frac{1}{s}\), where \(s \in \mathbb{C}\) is the complex variable of the zeta function \(\zeta(s)\). In this setup:
- **\(\tau = 0\)** corresponds to \(s = \infty\), placing infinity at the origin.
- **Large \(|\tau|\)** corresponds to \(s\) near 0.
- The "unit circle" could be interpreted as \(|\tau| = \delta\), where \(\delta\) is an infinitesimal, conceptually bounding the plane at a small scale.

The zeta function in this transformed plane becomes \(\zeta\left(\frac{1}{\tau}\right)\). The non-trivial zeros, located in the critical strip \(0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1\), map to regions in the \(\tau\)-plane where \(\operatorname{Re}(\tau) > 1\) or \(\operatorname{Re}(\tau) < -1\), depending on the sign of \(\tau\). Notably, the critical line \(s = \frac{1}{2} + it\) transforms into a curve:
\[
\tau = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} + it} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} - it}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + t^2}
\]
This curve doesn’t simplify into a straight line or circle, but it suggests that the \(\tau\)-plane reshapes the geometry of the zeta function’s domain.

### Expansion: A Geometric Twist with Logarithmic Scaling

To gain better insight into the zeta zeros, let’s expand this idea by incorporating natural logarithms and a 3D visualization, as you suggested. The zeta function’s behavior is often analyzed on logarithmic scales due to its oscillatory nature, tied to terms like \(e^{i\pi s}\) in its functional equation. Consider a further transformation in the \(\tau\)-plane:
\[
w = \log \tau = \log \left( \frac{1}{s} \right) = -\log s
\]
Here, \(\log\) is the complex logarithm, so if \(s = \sigma + it\), then:
\[
\log s = \log |s| + i \arg s = \log \sqrt{\sigma^2 + t^2} + i \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{\sigma}\right)
\]
Thus:
\[
w = -\log s = -\log \sqrt{\sigma^2 + t^2} - i \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{\sigma}\right)
\]
- **Real part of \(w\)**: \(-\log \sqrt{\sigma^2 + t^2}\), which grows negatively as \(|s|\) increases.
- **Imaginary part of \(w\)**: \(-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{\sigma}\right)\), ranging between \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

Now, the zeta function is expressed as \(\zeta\left(e^{-w}\right)\), since \(s = e^{-w}\). The critical line \(\sigma = \frac{1}{2}\) maps to a specific locus in the \(w\)-plane, where the real part of \(s\) is fixed, but the imaginary part (related to \(t\)) influences the argument.

#### 3D Visualization
To leverage your idea of "complex numbers in 3D," plot:
- **\(x\)-axis**: \(\operatorname{Re}(w) = -\log \sqrt{\sigma^2 + t^2}\)
- **\(y\)-axis**: \(\operatorname{Im}(w) = -\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{\sigma}\right)\)
- **\(z\)-axis**: \(|\zeta\left(e^{-w}\right)|\) (or separately, \(\operatorname{Re}(\zeta)\) and \(\operatorname{Im}(\zeta)\))

In this 3D space, the non-trivial zeros occur where \(\zeta\left(e^{-w}\right) = 0\), i.e., where both real and imaginary parts vanish. This logarithmic transformation compresses the infinite extent of the critical strip into a finite region, potentially making patterns in the zero distribution more discernible. For instance, as \(t \to \infty\) along \(\sigma = \frac{1}{2}\), \(\operatorname{Re}(w) \to -\infty\), but \(\operatorname{Im}(w)\) stabilizes near \(\pm \frac{\pi}{2}\), suggesting a cylindrical or ribbon-like structure centered around the critical line’s image.

### Twist: Spectral Resonance in the Logarithmic Plane

Here’s a twist: interpret the zeros as "resonances" in this transformed geometry, drawing from spectral theory. The zeta zeros are known to correspond to eigenvalues of certain operators (e.g., in the Selberg trace formula or hyperbolic geometry). In the \(w\)-plane, define a hypothetical operator whose spectrum aligns with the points where \(\zeta\left(e^{-w}\right) = 0\). The logarithmic scaling might reveal a harmonic structure:
- The imaginary parts of the zeros (\(t\)-values) often grow logarithmically (e.g., the \(n\)-th zero’s imaginary part is approximately \(\frac{2\pi n}{\log n}\)), and the \(-\log s\) transformation could linearize this growth, resembling a spectrum with regular spacing or clustering.

#### Random Matrix Connection
Random matrix theory suggests that zeta zeros mimic the eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices, with level repulsion in their spacing. In the \(w\)-plane, plot the transformed positions of known zeros (computed via methods like the Odlyzko-Schönhage algorithm). If their distribution along the \(\operatorname{Im}(w)\)-axis shows statistical regularity or symmetry, it could reinforce this analogy, offering a visual or analytical tool to probe the Riemann Hypothesis.

### Insight into Prime Distribution

Your interest in a "Prime conjecture" and finding primes at arbitrary scales ties to the zeta zeros via the explicit formula:
\[
\psi(x) = x - \sum_{\rho} \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho} - \text{smaller terms}
\]
where \(\rho\) are the non-trivial zeros. In the \(w\)-plane, the zeros’ transformed positions might group in ways that simplify this sum’s oscillatory terms. For example:
- If the \(w\)-plane highlights clusters or alignments along the critical line’s image, it could inspire new approximations for \(\psi(x)\), enhancing prime gap predictions.

### Practical Exploration

To test this tool’s insight:
1. **Visualize**: Compute \(\zeta\left(e^{-w}\right)\) for \(w\) along the transformed critical line and plot in 3D. Look for zero crossings or symmetries.
2. **Contour Analysis**: Use the argument principle in the \(w\)-plane to count zeros within contours, leveraging the logarithmic compression.
3. **Compute**: Adapt algorithms (e.g., Riemann-Siegel) to the \(w\)-domain and check if zero locations align with geometric features.

### Conclusion

This expansion—combining the \(\tau = \frac{1}{s}\) inversion with a logarithmic \(w = -\log s\) twist and 3D visualization—offers a promising tool for exploring the zeta zeros. By rescaling the complex plane and centralizing infinity, then mapping it logarithmically, we might uncover patterns or symmetries not evident in the standard view. While it doesn’t yet solve the Riemann Hypothesis, it provides a fresh geometric lens that could inspire new analytical or computational approaches, aligning with your goal of unlocking deeper insights into the zeta function and its connection to primes.
